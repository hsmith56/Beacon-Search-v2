# BEacon Student Search v2

This is the second iteration of a backend API that I made to help organize and connect profiles of students to families based on students interests.

Uses the [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) python tool to handle the dependencies and allow for better maintainability and hopefully portability as well.

This tool is not connected to or sponsored by any organization.
